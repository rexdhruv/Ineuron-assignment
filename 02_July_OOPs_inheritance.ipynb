    "* It promotes code reusability and provides a controlled way for subclasses to interact with inherited members.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Public members are accessible from any other class.\n",
    "* They can be accessed by any code that can access the instance of the class, including subclasses, unrelated classes, and even code outside the class hierarchy.\n",
